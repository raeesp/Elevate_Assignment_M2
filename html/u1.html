                <p></p>In an era dominated by online activities, ensuring the security of our digital lives is paramount. One of the
                emerging threats to user privacy and data integrity is JavaScript-based CPU side-channel attacks. These
                sophisticated attacks exploit vulnerabilities in the hardware to compromise sensitive information. To counter
                this threat, a new weapon has emerged - a Chrome extension designed to protect users against JavaScript-based
                CPU side-channel attacks. In this blog post, we will explore the dangers of these attacks, the role of the
                Chrome extension in safeguarding your browsing experience, and how you can take control of your online security.</p>
        
               </p> <span style="font-size: larger; color: rgb(208, 255, 0);">Understanding JavaScript-Based CPU Side-Channel Attacks:</span> <br>
                JavaScript-based CPU side-channel attacks leverage vulnerabilities in the underlying hardware to extract
                sensitive information. These attacks typically exploit the way modern processors handle operations, extracting
                data by analyzing variations in processing times or power consumption. While traditional security measures such
                as antivirus software and firewalls are essential, they may not be sufficient to combat these covert attacks,
                making specialized solutions necessary.</p>
        
            <p><span style="font-size: larger; color: rgb(208, 255, 0);">The Chrome Extension:</span> <br>Your Shield Against CPU Side-Channel Attacks:
